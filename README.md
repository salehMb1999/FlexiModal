# FlexiModal
Hello Everyone!

This is another small step in my frontend learning journey. I hope you find it enjoyable.

In this project, I've created something very useful and practical that you can commonly find on most websites: a customizable Modal.

You can tailor it to your specific needs. I've utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to bring this project to life.

I hope you like it! If you had a good time with it, I'd be thrilled if you could give it a star.

Thank you!
